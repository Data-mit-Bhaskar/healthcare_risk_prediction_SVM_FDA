# **Healthcare Risk Prediction using SVM**
*A **Semester 1 MSc. Data Analytics** project at **Berlin School of Business & Innovation (BSBI)**, where I applied **machine learning (SVM)** and **data preprocessing techniques** to predict health risks based on patient data. This project directly aligns with my professional experience at **Sakon (GSG)**, where I optimized data workflows and reduced errors by **11%**, and my academic focus on **predictive modeling for real-world applications**.

---

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project analyzes a **healthcare dataset** (with attributes like age, BMI, blood pressure, smoking habits, and exercise frequency) to predict **health risk levels** (Normal, Moderate High, High, Critical) using a **Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. The goal was to build a model that could help medical centers **identify high-risk patients** and recommend preventive measures—mirroring my work at **Sakon**, where I translated complex datasets into actionable insights for **1,200+ customer accounts**.

### **Key Achievements**
✅ **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and structured raw healthcare data using **Pandas** and **KNN Imputer** for missing values.
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generated **pair plots** and **correlation heatmaps** to identify trends (e.g., BMI vs. health risk).
✅ **Model Training**: Implemented a **Linear SVM** with **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables and **StandardScaler** for feature scaling.
✅ **Evaluation**: Achieved **67% accuracy** (with room for improvement via class balancing or hyperparameter tuning).
✅ **Actionable Insights**: Identified **BMI, stress levels, and exercise frequency** as key predictors of health risk—aligning with my **MBA in Supply Chain Management**, where I analyzed how operational factors impact outcomes.
